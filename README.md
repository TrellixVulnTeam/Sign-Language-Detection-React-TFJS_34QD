# Sign-Language-Detection-React-TFJS

This project is an end-to-end custom object detection model that allows you to translate sign language in real time. 
In this project, I used Tensorflow Object Detection. Along with that I used transfer learning to train a deep learning model. 
I also used OpenCV for collecting images for deep learning. To label images for sign language detection, I used LabelImg.
